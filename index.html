                            This is an artificial design. The application was developed with the aim of practical
                            application of design patterns and learning to design the architecture of the application.
                            The main task was to create an application in which it would be easy to add new functions
                            (in my case, such functions, for example, are console commands for which you need to check
                            the syntax, process and report the result). In addition, the project was also aimed at
                            developing communication skills, as this is a team project. The team and I thought about the
                            architecture, I wrote the code, and we wrote a progress report. <br><br>

                            As I am fond of aviation, the project was created to conveniently store the history of my
                            flights in flight simulators. It has a user-friendly interface with a date-time scale so
                            that you can visually see the duration of any flight. It is able to record the flight
                            through the connection with the flight simulator. You can make a pre-registration of a
                            future flight and see detailed information about it. Automatic estimation of flight distance
                            and conversion of 4-letter airport code to airport city using remote database API. The
                            graphical interface was created using the PyQT5 library, without any additional graphical
                            programs. <br><br>

                            The project was developed for presentation at a scientific and practical conference.
                            Although I do not specialize in neural networks and machine learning, the project shows that
                            I am able to use even a technology that I have never touched before. An auxiliary
                            questionnaire website was also created for the project. The program can predict the
                            emotional coloring of the text both by entering text into the corresponding line, and by
                            reading a lot of texts from a file and evaluating each of them separately. <br><br>

                            An active project, originally developed to accept applications within an online game, now
                            has many purposes. Currently used by real people for two years now, maintained by me.
                            Implemented functions: sending/reviewing complaints/appeals, personnel reporting, work with
                            personnel, personnel ranks, remote execution of commands, access to logs on a remote server.
                            The website is associated with the online game and the remote server in various ways and can
                            access them to fulfill the user's requests. <br><br>

                            An active project, used by hundreds of people daily. The project is the introduction of an
                            RPG component into a popular online game. The project rather shows the ability to think
                            through a complex complex system with a large number of relationships. Continues to be
                            developed and maintained at the present time. <br><br>
